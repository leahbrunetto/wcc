# Python Course with Women's Coding Collective
In February 2017, I took this one month online Python course with the Women's Coding Collective (a wonderful meetup and mini course platform
that sadly no longer exists). This course provided programming basics and opportunities to make simple applications such as a Mad Libs
generator, tip calculator, and Blackjack game. It also went over web scraping which was an entirely new topic for me.
